        <strong><a href="jmp-matt-curtis.pdf">The her in inheritance: marriage and mobility in Quebec 1800–1970 </a></strong> </p>
        <p>
         When did spouses begin to strongly match on economic ability?  Many believe it is a modern development, a consequence of rising female employment and education levels. Using a large new dataset from Quebec, I find that marriage in Quebec was highly assortative as far back as the early 19th century. Moreover, assortment was not merely matching between similar families, but instead depended on the human capital of both men and women as individuals. Finally, I show that the abilities of women mattered as much as that of their husbands for the outcomes of their children. Strongly assortative marriage had always been important because the human capital of women mattered as much as that of men for marriage and mobility.

        <strong><a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s13524-020-00898-0">Twins Support the Absence of Parity-Dependent Fertility Control in Pretransition Populations
</a></strong> with Gregory Clark and Neil Cummins. <i> Demography.</i> (2020).
        </p>
        <p>
         A conclusion of the European Fertility Project in 1986 was that pretransition populations mostly displayed <i>natural fertility</i>, where parity-dependent birth control was absent. This conclusion has recently been challenged for England by new empirical results and has also been widely rejected by theorists of long-run economic growth, where pre-industrial fertility control is integral to most models. In this study, we use the accident of twin births to show that for three Western European–derived pre-industrial populations—namely, England (1730–1879), France (1670–1788), and Québec (1621–1835)—we find no evidence for parity-dependent control of marital fertility. If a twin was born in any of these populations, family size increased by 1 compared with families with a singleton birth at the same parity and mother age, with no reduction of subsequent fertility. Numbers of children surviving to age 14 also increased. Twin births also show no differential effect on fertility when they occurred at high parities; this finding is in contrast to populations where fertility is known to have been controlled by at least some families, such as in England, 1900–1949, where a twin birth increased average births per family by significantly less than 1.

        <p>
         While it plays a key role in theories of the transition to modern economic growth, there are few estimates of the quantity-quality trade-off from before the demographic transition. Using a uniquely suitable new dataset of vital records, I use two instrumental variables — twin births and aggregate infant mortality shocks — to estimate the trade-off in Quebec between 1620 and 1850. I find strong evidence of a trade–off between family size and child literacy, albeit a relatively modest one.  </p>

        <strong> Resource curses and production functions: Sugar, coffee, and schooling in early 20th-century Puerto Rico </strong>  with Mateo Uribe-Castro.</p>
       <p>
        One way natural resource abundance can be a curse is if it crowds out investment in human capital. Higher wages in the primary sector raise incomes but also encourage children to leave school to work.  Using newly digitized records from early 20th century Puerto Rico, we argue that the suitability of child labor in production determines if the substitution effect or the income effect dominates for schooling. The export of coffee, a crop children could easily harvest, reduced elementary school attendance. However, the export of sugar increased both enrollment and attendance. Evidence from Census microdata support the hypothesis that the substitution effect is stronger for coffee production than for sugar. The suitability of child labor in production is thus crucial when considering the importance of commodity booms to economic growth, both past or present,

        <strong>The Mismeasure of Man: Why Intergenerational Occupational Mobility is Much Lower than Conventionally Measured, England, 1800-2021</strong>.</p>
        <p>
        Using a new database of 1.7 m marriages in England 1837-1939, and a genealogy of 413,000 people in England 1700-2021, we estimate two new occupational status indices for England in the years
1800-1939. These new indices show that there was much less social mobility 1800-1939 than previous indices, such as HISCAM, suggested. The performance of these new indices, however, illustrates a
general problem with comparing social mobility across time and place using status indices. All such indices embody unknown and varying degrees of error. The more error, the more apparent mobility.
In the concluding section of the paper we develop a way of measuring intergenerational occupational status mobility which eliminates all measurement error. This suggests that occupational status
persistence in England 1800-2021 was always much greater than conventionally measured, and was largely unchanged over time.   </p>

        <strong>Cultural Inheritance and the European Marriage Pattern</strong> with Gregory Clark and Neil Cummins.</p>
        <p>

Eric Turkheimer famously stated as a Law "All human behavioral traits are heritable." But this poses a puzzle for pre-industrial demographic systems, such as the European Marriage Pattern, where individuals made behavioral choices that limited fertility. Why were these behaviors not replaced over time with those that generated higher fertility? Some have argued the solution to this puzzle is that limited fertility in the first generation was actually maximal fertility in subsequent generations. But we show that there was no fertility penalty to future generations from higher fertility in the initial generation in both England and Quebec. Here we argue instead that the European Marriage Pattern survived for more than 500 years because, for pre-industrial fertility behavior, Turkheimer's Law does not hold. Even though at the social level fertility limiting behaviors transmitted strongly, there was scant familial inheritance of fertility behaviors. So fertility enhancing deviations did not get transmitted across generations, and the European Marriage Pattern could persist indefinitely.       </p>
